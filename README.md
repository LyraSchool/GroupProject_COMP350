## Usage

Ensure that make, gcc, bcc, and nasm are installed.

`make simulator` uses the simulator by Dr. Black to load the disk and execute it.
Make sure that the settings are set to: Cylinders: 63, Heads: 255, Sectors: 100
This requires java to be installed!

If qemu is installed, `make qemu` will use `qemu-system-x86-64` to load the disk and execute it.
